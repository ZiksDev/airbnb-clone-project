# Project Goals

1-User Management: Secure registration, login, and profiles

2-Property Management: Add, update, and view listings

3-Booking System: Reserve and manage property bookings

4-Payments: Process and record transactions

5-Reviews: Leave ratings and feedback

6-Data Optimization: Improve database speed and storage

# Technology Stack

1-Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.

2-Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.

3-PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.

4-GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.

5-Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.

6-Redis: Used for caching and session management.

7-Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

8-CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Team Roles

Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic/
Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations/
DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services/

# API Security

Security Measures for Airbnb-like Platform
üîê Key Security Measures
Authentication & Authorization

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - SMS/email verification, TOTP apps
JWT Tokens - Short-lived tokens (15-30 min) with refresh rotation
OAuth 2.0 - Secure social login with Google/Facebook
Role-Based Access Control - Separate permissions for guests, hosts, admins

Data Protection

Encryption - AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
GDPR Compliance - Data minimization, right to be forgotten, consent management
Field-Level Encryption - Extra protection for sensitive personal data

Payment Security

PCI DSS Compliance - No card data storage, tokenization only
Fraud Prevention - ML algorithms, geolocation checks, velocity limits
3D Secure Authentication - Additional verification for card payments

API Security

Rate Limiting - 1000 requests/hour per user, stricter for sensitive endpoints
Input Validation - SQL injection and XSS prevention
Web Application Firewall (WAF) - Filter malicious traffic
Real-time Monitoring - Automated threat detection and blocking

Infrastructure Security

Network Isolation - VPC with private subnets for databases
DDoS Protection - Cloud-based traffic filtering
Regular Updates - Automated security patches and vulnerability scanning


üéØ Why Security is Critical
User Management

Risk: Identity theft, account takeover, personal data exposure
Impact: GDPR fines (up to 4% revenue), user exodus, reputation damage

Payment System

Risk: Credit card fraud, money laundering, financial data theft
Impact: Massive financial losses, payment processor suspension, legal liability

Property Listings

Risk: Fake listings, scams, location privacy breaches
Impact: Guest safety incidents, host distrust, platform liability

Booking System

Risk: Price manipulation, double bookings, session hijacking
Impact: Financial disputes, guest/host conflicts, booking chaos

Admin Dashboard

Risk: Complete system compromise, insider threats
Impact: Total platform control by attackers, all data exposed

Reviews & Ratings

Risk: Fake reviews, reputation manipulation, defamatory content
Impact: Unfair competition, legal liability, system credibil
